# CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

The Three Horizons Platform implements a robust CI/CD pipeline architecture to automate the software delivery process, ensuring reliable, consistent, and efficient deployment of applications.

## Key CI/CD Components

### Source Control Management

- **GitHub** as the central repository for all code and configuration
- Branch protection rules to enforce quality gates
- Pull Request workflows for code reviews and collaboration
- Automated testing triggered on pull requests

### Continuous Integration

- **GitHub Actions** for automated build and test processes
- Automated code quality checks and static analysis
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Unit and integration testing
- Container image building and scanning

### Continuous Delivery

- Automated deployment to development, testing, and staging environments
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environment provisioning
- Configuration management through GitOps principles
- Deployment validation and smoke tests
- Rollback mechanisms for failed deployments

### Continuous Deployment

- Progressive deployment to production environments
- Blue/Green deployment strategy for zero-downtime upgrades
- Canary releases for controlled feature rollout
- Automated post-deployment monitoring and validation
- Performance and reliability testing in production-like environments

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Code**: Developers write code and commit to feature branches
2. **Build**: Automated build process compiles code and creates artifacts
3. **Test**: Automated testing validates functionality and quality
4. **Release**: Artifacts are prepared and versioned for deployment
5. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to target environments
6. **Operate**: Monitoring and management of deployed applications
7. **Observe**: Gathering metrics and feedback for continuous improvement

## Benefits

- Reduced manual intervention and human error
- Faster time-to-market for new features
- Consistent and repeatable deployment process
- Improved software quality through automated testing
- Better visibility and traceability across the development lifecycle
- Enhanced security through automated scanning and validation
