## Key Security Components

### Identity and Access Management

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** integration for centralized identity management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained permission management
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security
- Just-in-time (JIT) access for privileged operations
- Service principals and managed identities for secure service-to-service authentication

### Network Security

- Virtual Network isolation for all services
- Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control traffic flow
- Private Endpoints for secure access to PaaS services
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web vulnerabilities
- DDoS Protection for infrastructure protection

### Data Security

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Key Vault for secure key and secret management
- Private data storage with no public access
- Data classification and protection policies
- Regular security scanning and compliance checks

### Application Security

- Secure development practices following OWASP guidelines
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Runtime application security monitoring
- Container image scanning for vulnerabilities
- Regular penetration testing

## Compliance and Governance

The platform is designed to meet enterprise security requirements and compliance standards, including:

- ISO 27001
- GDPR
- Industry-specific regulations
- Internal security governance policies

Security controls are continuously monitored and regularly audited to ensure ongoing compliance and protection against emerging threats.
