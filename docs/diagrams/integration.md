# Integration Architecture

This diagram illustrates how the Three Horizons Platform integrates with external systems and services, showing the key integration patterns and connection points.

## Integration Overview

The Three Horizons Platform provides several integration mechanisms to connect with external systems:

1. **API Gateway** - Managed interface for external API consumers
2. **Event Hub** - Event-driven integration using publish/subscribe patterns
3. **Service Connections** - Direct connections to external services
4. **Data Integration** - ETL and data synchronization patterns
5. **Identity Federation** - Integration with external identity providers

## Integration Patterns

The platform supports several integration patterns:

### 1. API-Based Integration

- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- GraphQL for flexible data queries
- API versioning and lifecycle management
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API monitoring and analytics

### 2. Event-Driven Integration

- Publish/subscribe messaging
- Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Webhook delivery for real-time notifications
- Dead letter queues for error handling
- Event schema registry

### 3. Batch Integration

- Scheduled data synchronization
- Bulk data transfers
- ETL processes
- File-based integration
- Data validation and transformation

## Integration Workflow

The integration workflow diagram shows how data and events flow between systems:

![Integration Workflow](/img/diagrams/integration-workflow.svg)

1. **Source System** - Initiates the integration
2. **Integration Layer** - Handles transformation and routing
3. **Target System** - Receives and processes the data
4. **Monitoring** - Tracks the integration status

## Security Considerations

The platform implements several security controls for integrations:

- **Authentication** - OAuth 2.0 and API keys
- **Authorization** - Fine-grained access control
- **Encryption** - TLS for all communications
- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive logging of all integration activities
- **Data Validation** - Input validation and sanitization
