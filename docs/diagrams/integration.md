## Key Integration Components

### API Management

- **Azure API Management** as the central API gateway
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger standards
- Policy-based API governance and security
- Rate limiting and traffic shaping
- API versioning and lifecycle management

### Integration Services

- **Azure Integration Services** for orchestrating complex integration workflows
- Service Bus for reliable message delivery
- Event Grid for event-driven architectures
- Logic Apps for visual workflow integration
- API Connectors for common SaaS applications

### Data Integration

- ETL/ELT pipelines for batch data processing
- Change data capture for real-time data synchronization
- Data Lake integration for analytics and reporting
- Master data management services
- Data quality and governance tools

### Enterprise Connectivity

- On-premises connectivity through hybrid network solutions
- VPN and ExpressRoute for secure connectivity
- Integration with legacy systems and databases
- B2B integration capabilities for partner systems
- Secure file transfer protocols

## Integration Patterns

The platform supports various integration patterns to address different use cases:

1. **Request-Response**: Synchronous API-based integration
2. **Publish-Subscribe**: Event-driven asynchronous integration
3. **Message Queuing**: Reliable asynchronous communication
4. **File Transfer**: Batch processing of data files
5. **Database Integration**: Direct database connectivity
6. **Webhook Integration**: Event notification to external systems

## Benefits

- Simplified connectivity to enterprise systems
- Reduced integration complexity and maintenance
